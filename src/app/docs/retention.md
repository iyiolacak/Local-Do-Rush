Staleness Detection:
“No logs in 6 hours” → triggers a recalibration of reward timing or a nudge.

Dynamic Challenge Scaling:
“Only short tasks this week?” → subtly suggest a harder one to rebalance skill-to-challenge.

Real Feedback Loops:
Instead of static reward settings, you now have the minimum viable data to generate live, adaptive experiences — like a dungeon that reshapes itself based on how you move through it.
