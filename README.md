# Locally Loop | Productivity at Localhost

A **local-first**, **frictionless**, gamified productivity tool. From intention to impact in a single line and no plans, no pause, just progress.

Drop the chore of to-do lists **Inspired by the flow state and reward loops of gaming (e.g., League of Legends)**, Locally Loop requires **zero task maintenance**, you simply type what you did or want to do, hit Enter, and get instant XP and feedback.

Locally Loop lives right in your browser(CLI soon). No backend, no telemetry, so every action is private, persistent, and lightning-fast. Simply type what you did("fed my car")

## üéØ Key Features

* **Ambient Input Bar**: A single persistent input field; no to-do lists, no multi-step forms.
* **Instant Logging & Completion**: Type in natural language to **create** or **complete** tasks with one keystroke.
* **Ephemeral Feedback**: Micro-animations and toasts flash to reward actions without breaking flow.
* **LLM-Driven Logic**: The model handles intent detection, state transitions, and summary generation via function calls.
* **Local-First & Private**: All data is stored in-browser (localStorage/IndexedDB); nothing is sent externally*.
* **Session Summaries & Evolution**: On-demand recaps and growth narratives powered by LLM functions.
* **Modular Architecture**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS, with clean separation of UI, hooks/services, and state.

*: Although Locally Loop is fully local in storage and architecture, it leverages an external LLM endpoint to interpret inputs, generate rewards, and craft summaries. Treat it like ChatGPT: your inputs are sent to a language model service, but no persistent account data, telemetry, or analytics are ever transmitted.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

1. **Log or Complete**

   * Click or focus the ambient input bar (hotkey `/`).
   * Type your action, e.g., `Fixed import bug` or `Start blog outline`, and press Enter.
   * Instantly see a toast:
     `Fixed import bug logged! +25 XP (Execution‚Üë)`

2. **Next Micro-Step**

   * For forward-looking inputs, the app may suggest the next step:
     `Next: Write test cases (+10 XP)`
   * Press Enter again or click "Go" in the toast to accept.

3. **Open Overlays**

   * **Session Summary**: Press `S` to open a text-rich recap of your current session.
   * **Evolution**: Press `E` to view your cumulative skill bars and growth narrative.
   * **Journal**: Press `J` to browse chronological logs of all sessions.
   * **Pre-Quest Lobby**: Press `L` to see the lobby countdown for high-stakes quests.

4. **Persisting Data**

   * All session entries and history are automatically persisted using Zustand's `persist` middleware in your browser‚Äôs localStorage.

## üîå LLM Integration & Function API

The app communicates with an LLM endpoint via these functions:

1. `list_active_tasks`
2. `create_new_task`
3. `complete_task`
4. `skip_task`
5. `calculate_reward`
6. `get_session_summary`
7. `get_evolution_stats`
8. `generate_reflective_quote`

Invoke the LLM by sending:

```json
{ "inputText": "‚Ä¶", "context": { activeTasks, recentEntries, userStats, timestamp } }
```

The model returns one of the function calls, which the client handles and updates state.

## üîç Why This Exists

* **Eliminate Friction:** Traditional TODO apps trap you in lists and upkeep. Here, you **only type**.
* **Protect Flow:** No modals, dashboards, or clicks‚Äîjust an ambient bar & micro-feedback.
* **Maximize Motivation:** Instant XP, rare loot bursts, and reflective narratives drive dopamine loops.
* **Local & Private:** Your data never leaves your browser. No accounts or telemetry.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development & Contributing

* **Testing:** `npm run test` (Jest + React Testing Library)
* **Linting:** `npm run lint` (ESLint + Prettier)
* **Make changes** on a feature branch, open a PR, and I'll review.
